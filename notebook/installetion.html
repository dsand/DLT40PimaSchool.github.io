Installing Miniconda3 under Linux or macOS
--------------------------------------------
Download the appropriate installer for your OS here:https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html#
For macOS, you can choose between a "package" or "bash" version. 
I find it easier to follow the bash version, but the package versionwill work too. 
I recommend you make the following choices describedbelow.
1)  Accept the license / terms of use.
2)  Do not install for all users, but just one the current user.
3)  You might be asked whether or not to allow the installer to issue"conda init".  
Answering "no" will require you to activate condayourself each time you open a new terminal, 
following the instructionsthat will be provided during installation.  
Make sure you record theseinstructions if you choose "no".  
I recommend answering "yes".  This will set some environment variables persistently in 
your shell so thatconda is setup every time you open a terminal.  
I recommend "yes", andthe remaining instructions assume that you have done so.
During the installation, take note of the installation location of miniconda in your log file.
The default instalation should put conda here:  YOUR_HOME_DIRECTORY/opt/miniconda3/

Installing PIMA  Conda Environment
------------------------------------------
Make sure your conda is fully up to date with:
conda update conda
then follow the prompts, e.g. selecting "y" as needed to update any out-of-date packages.
We'll be using a conda environment specifically for PIMA school to avoid conflicts 
with any other projects on your computer, and to ensure that we all have the same software installed.  
To create our environment:
conda create -n pima python=3.8 numpy scipy matplotlib ipython jupyter

-------------------------------------------------------------
Starting pima Conda Environment and Jupyter Notebook
-------------------------------------------------------------
Activate the pima python environment with 
conda activate pima 
Then launch jupyter notebook with:
jupyter notebook
Note that the directory in which you run this command will be the rootdirectory in your jupyter notebook.  Keep this in mind when you arereading or writing data files!When you are done with Phy 80 for the session you can deactivate theenvironment with:conda deactivate
